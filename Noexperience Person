It is better to start with Scratch programming language at scratch.mit.edu or downloading scratch 3.0. It is a block based and a simple programming language used to 
learn programming languages. I have slowly learned programming language through scratch. It is for the purpose of kids to learn programming language and non coders 
to learn how to code
